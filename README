cast: be a wizard
====================

Cast is a framework for deploying applications, written in Node.js.

Cast provides tools for system administrators and developers to create, 
deploy, maintain, and monitor distributed services, written in any language.

Cast's internals are structured around building RESTful APIs for all 
operations, so that all tasks can be scripted and more powerful tools
can be built on top.
