12.07.2011 - v0.2.0 (stable, checkpoint):
 * Added new job execution framework.
 * Minor REST API cleanup. Returned JSON is now in a more standard format,
   and most PUT and POST methods create jobs which are completed
   asynchronously.
 * Improved locking of resources, including those that don't use jobs (ie,
   bundles).
 * Added experimental plugin interface.
 * Client cleanup and improvements.
 * New 'deploy' command that intelligently uploads bundles and creates or
   upgrades instances.
 * Added '--debug' option to client and agent. When set on both, stack traces
   are returned to the client and shown with error messages.

 * Fix a bug with invalid handling of the symlinks in the Cast bundles

17.05.2011 - v0.1.1 (hotfix):

   window size could not be detected
