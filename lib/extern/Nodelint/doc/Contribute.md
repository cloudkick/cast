Contribute to Nodelint
----------------------

Nodelint is a pretty simple project already, but if you have some enhancements you would like to add,
this project is hosted on github, so just fork and send a pull request with your updates.

Testing
-------

Testing is done directly on the Nodelint project. Just run "make test" from the root directory.

**Note:** There is one expected error in the test/error.js file, for testing error output. This is also why 
there is a custom pre-commit script to handle that error from blocking commits.
