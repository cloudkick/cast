 * @name node.events
 * @namespace
 * Many objects in Node emit events: a &lt;code>net.Server&lt;/code> emits an event each time
 * a peer connects to it, a &lt;code>fs.readStream&lt;/code> emits an event when the file is
 * opened. All objects which emit events are instances of &lt;code>events.EventEmitter&lt;/code>.
 * You can access this module by doing: &lt;code>require("events");&lt;/code>
 *
 * Typically, event names are represented by a camel-cased string, however,
 * there aren't any strict restrictions on that, as any string will be accepted.
 *
 * Functions can then be attached to objects, to be executed when an event
 * is emitted. These functions are called &lt;em>listeners&lt;/em>.
