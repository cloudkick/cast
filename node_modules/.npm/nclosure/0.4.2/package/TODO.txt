TODO
====

HIGH
----

- Better jsdoc stylesheet

- Why do we need to include lib/ and bin/ in all nclosure runs.  This should
 not be required as its just polluting the compiler with sutff 99% of people
 will not use.  If we are using the code in here it should be moved somewhere
 better.

- Remove all if (typeof(goog) !== undefined) ... Its a hack

MED
---

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

- The compiled file does not run.  Not too critical as on the server start up
time is less of a priority.


LOW
---

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
